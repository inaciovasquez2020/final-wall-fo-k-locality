Assumptions and Limitations

1. Observation channels have finite information capacity.
2. Operators satisfy locality or exponential off-diagonal decay.
3. No claim is made for unrestricted polynomial-time algorithms.
4. Any computational interpretations are explicitly conditional.
5. The result does not assert P vs NP or any Clay resolution.
