Finite Information Coercivity

This directory contains an abstract operator-theoretic result:

Finite-information observation channels combined with locality imply
spectral coercivity modulo finite defect.

The result is stated independently of computational complexity claims.
Any complexity-theoretic interpretations are conditional and not asserted
here.

This module is logically separate from the FO^k Final Wall and may be
read independently.
