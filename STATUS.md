Proven (unconditional)
- Reduction of FO^k locality-based refinement methods to a single terminal obstruction ("Final Wall")
- Formal isolation of the FO^k Locality Wall as a structural boundary, not a solved decision problem

Conditional (explicit hypotheses)
- Any lower-bound amplification beyond the wall depends on unresolved rigidity or expansion assumptions
- Any algorithmic implications depend on admissibility / locality constraints as stated in the papers

Open / reduction targets
- Resolution of the final rigidity obstruction (outside the scope of this repository)
