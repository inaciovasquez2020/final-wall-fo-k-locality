Title
Final Wall for FO^k Locality

State
Theory-complete, conditional.

Summary
All reductions from FO^k locality to a single obstruction are complete.
The only remaining dependency is the Overlap Rigidity Lemma.

Dependency
Overlap Rigidity:
FO^4 detection of independent overlapping cycles at bounded radius.

Notes
No further development is planned in this repository.
Any future work must occur in a separate formalization or synthesis project.
