# Oblivion Rigidity and the Final Wall of FO^k Locality

Status: Framework-complete, theorem-conditional.

This repository contains a structural reduction of FO^k locality,
isolating a single open conjecture ("Final Wall / Oblivion Conjecture").

No solution is claimed.
All results are conditional on the stated conjecture.
