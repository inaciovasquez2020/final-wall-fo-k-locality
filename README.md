Final Wall: FO^k Locality Obstruction

This repository records the terminal obstruction ("Final Wall") encountered by FO^k-local, bounded-degree, and refinement-based methods.

Contents
- README.md: scope and interpretation
- STATUS.md: authoritative claim boundary
- ARCHIVE.md: historical notes and deprecated paths
- Oblivion_Final_Wall.tex: canonical technical manuscript
- docs/: supporting technical notes
- operator-theory/: supporting reductions

What this repository establishes
- A precise reduction of a broad class of locality-based methods to a single terminal obstruction
- Identification of the obstruction as structural, not algorithmic

What this repository does NOT claim
- No solution to P vs NP or related decision problems
- No resolution of the terminal rigidity obstruction
- No claims beyond those listed in STATUS.md

Status
This repository is frozen as a record of the Final Wall.
Extensions, resolutions, or breakthroughs must occur elsewhere.

See STATUS.md for the authoritative boundary.
