# Oblivion Rigidity and the Final Wall of FO^k Locality  
**Reference Boundary Artifact for Descriptive Complexity**

---

## Scope

This repository is a **Tier A module** in the **Scientific Infrastructure (URF)**.  
It serves as the **reference boundary object** for FO^k locality and related
descriptive complexity programs.

It does **not** contain a proof.  
It does **not** host active development.

It exists to isolate and formalize a single irreducible open problem:
the **Final Wall / Oblivion Conjecture**.

This repository is a **frozen scientific reference**.

---

## Institutional Verification

- **Artifact Type:** Framework-Level Reduction / Reference Archive  
- **Status:** Public Archive / Frozen Boundary  
- **Framework Alignment:** Unified Rigidity Framework (URF) — Locality Frontier  

---

## Significance Statement

The **Oblivion Rigidity Framework** isolates the terminal obstruction
in locality-based complexity theory.

It formalizes the statement:

> All known locality-based rigidity arguments reduce to a single
> unresolved combinatorial principle (the Oblivion Conjecture).

This repository provides:

- a complete reduction pipeline,
- formal equivalence between multiple rigidity formulations,
- a canonical definition of the final unresolved boundary.

It does not attempt to resolve the conjecture.
It exists to **define the problem precisely and permanently**.

## Core Object

### The Final Wall / Oblivion Conjecture

There exists a structural invariant of bounded-degree graphs such that:

- FO^k-local homogeneity
- combined with sufficiently rich cycle overlap

forces global asymmetry at bounded radius.

This conjecture is equivalent to:

- Overlap Determinacy  
- Hypergraph Gadget Rigidity  
- FO^k Local Cycle Rigidity  
- Configuration Support Compression  

All equivalences are formalized here.

---

## Role in URF

This module functions as:

- the **terminal boundary of the URF program**,  
- the unique unresolved mathematical core,  
- the formal limit of all locality-based rigidity methods.

Every other URF component either:
- proves a special case, or  
- reduces to this object.
